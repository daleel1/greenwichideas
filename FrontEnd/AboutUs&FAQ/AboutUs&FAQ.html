              <h4>What is the Ideas Centre?</h4>
              <p>
                The Ideas Centre is an interactive tool to help us share ideas
                about the work we do at the university. We want to use it to
                encourage collaboration and for staff across the university to
                discuss topics of interest informally and effectively to get
                feedback and help create solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any posts which contravene the Acceptable Use Policy (available
                in the Ideas Centre) and/or the
                <a

                  >IT/Staff Rule of Conduct</a
                >
                will be edited or deleted by an administrator. All posts should
                aim to stimulate constructive feedback, be focussed on sharing
                best practice and be supportive of colleagues.

              <h4>What are Featured Ideas?</h4>
              <p>
                Featured Ideas are ideas the administrators want to showcase;
                these can change regularly, and ideas may be showcased to
                encourage discussion or to raise awareness of ideas that have
                had little interaction.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>What are Popular Ideas?</h4>
              <p>
                Popular Ideas are the ideas which are the most active in the
                Ideas Centre.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>What are Recent Ideas?</h4>
              <p>
                Recent Ideas are the ideas which have been submitted most
                recently.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Where else can I see the ideas submitted?</h4>
              <p>
                You will be able to see all of the ideas submitted in the Ideas
                Centre. A rolling feed of ideas and/or comments will be added to
                the <a href="">Staff Portal home page</a>, so you will be able
                to view some of the activity there.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Who else can see the ideas submitted?</h4>
              <p>
                The Ideas Centre is an open tool, and should therefore only be
                used for non-confidential items. Only members of the University
                of Greenwich community can comment on and vote for ideas, but
                although indexing has been restricted, ideas may be viewable
                outside of the university community.

              <h3 id="registering">Registering</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Why do I need to register?</h4>
              <p>
                You can view content in the Ideas Centre without registering,
                but all ideas and comments in the Ideas Centre need to be
                attributable to staff in the university, hence the need to
                register. This not only allows us to follow up on ideas that
                need further exploration, but it also means that if any
                inappropriate behaviour takes place we are able to deal with
                this quickly and efficiently.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>How do I register?</h4>
              <p>
                You can register using the ‘sign up here’ link on the Ideas
                Centre main page. You will need to enter a ‘display name’ and
                university email address to complete this. Your display name
                will show alongside all ideas and comments you make in the Ideas
                Centre, this should be in lower case and without spaces. Please
                do not use your university short code in this field.<br />
                You will receive an email, to your registered email address,
                providing your system generated password, which we recommend you
                change the first time you use the system.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Why can I only register with my university email address?</h4>
              <p>
                Access to the Ideas Centre is restricted to university staff,
                therefore only email addresses with a University of Greenwich
                suffix are permitted to register on the system.
              </p>
              <h3 id="submitting-ideas">Submitting an idea</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>How do I submit an idea?</h4>
              <p>
                To submit an idea click on the ‘Submit an idea’ link in the
                header of the Ideas Centre. You will be prompted to enter a
                title for your idea, the details of it. You are able to upload
                images or PDF files only, that help explain or support your
                idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                You should also choose an appropriate category and tags for your
                ideas, as these will help with the analysis we will need to
                complete on all the ideas submitted. You can suggest a new
                category for the administrators to approve if you feel none of
                the existing categories are a good fit. If a new category is
                approved it will be automatically added to your idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                You should also choose the appropriate tags to add to your idea,
                unlike categories, if you add a new tag, this will be added to
                your idea immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have completed all the fields, and checked your idea,
                then click on Submit Idea. Please note: once you have submitted
                your idea you will be unable to edit it without contacting an
                administrator.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Why can I only upload image and PDF files with my idea?</h4>
              <p>
                The reason for this is to prevent documents with viruses being
                uploaded and shared widely across the university. While images
                and PDF files can contain viruses, it is less common than other
                file formats.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>What categories do I use?</h4>
              <p>
                There is a short list of categories already in the Ideas Centre,
                these relate to the topics the Ideas Centre is being used for,
                and so you should choose the most appropriate one.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you don’t think your idea fits into any of these categories
                you can click ‘Suggest New Category’ and type in a category for
                the administrators to approve. If the administrators approve
                your suggestion it will be automatically added to your idea and
                available for other people to use.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4><strong>What tags do I use?</strong></h4>
              <p>
                You should also choose the appropriate tags to add to your idea,
                unlike categories, if you add a new tag, this will be added to
                your idea immediately and available for other people to use.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>How do I add a new tag?</h4>
              <p>
                To add a new tag click on the ‘Add New Tags’ link and type the
                new tags you would like into the box displayed. You can submit
                multiple new tags but separating them with a comma. The tags you
                create will be available for everyone to use, so please do check
                they don’t exist already before creating a new tag.
              </p>

            <li>
              <h4>How can I edit or delete my idea?</h4>
              <p>
                Once submitted you are unable to edit or delete your ideas, you
                can

              <h4>How are ideas moderated?</h4>
              <p>
                Ideas are reviewed daily, and we encourage a wide range of ideas
                from staff across the university. Any ideas that contravene the
                IT and Staff Codes of Conduct will be redacted or deleted by an
                administrator. If you believe an idea or comment(s) contravene
                the IT or Staff Codes of Conduct then
                <a

              <h4>How can I comment anonymously?</h4>
              <p>
                We encourage you to comment openly as much as possible, and
                therefore if you want to comment anonymously you should consider
                if that comment should be left at all. You can withhold your
                name from a comment, and we understand there may be rare
                circumstances where you may want to do this, however if everyone
                were to withhold their names for all comments we do not think we
                would get as much value out of the Ideas Centre.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you choose to withhold your name on a comment, your name and
                IP address will be visible to the Ideas Centre administrators.
